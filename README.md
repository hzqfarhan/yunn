Hi there! I’m Farhan or more known as Yunn, an aspiring Software Engineer student currently diving deep into the world of Mobile Dev & Backend System. I love the challenge of solving puzzles through code and creating seamless user experiences.

These days I’m focused on:

• Strengthening my foundation in Java and Python

• Version control and collaborative development via Git

• Small, open-source projects with high impact
